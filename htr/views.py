"""
The `views` module defines the views for the 'htr' Django application.

This module contains the functions that handle requests and generate responses
for different web pages and actions within the 'htr' application.

Views:
- render_page: Renders a specific page template and returns the corresponding HTTP response.

Note:
- This module assumes the presence of the following packages and modules:
    - `django.shortcuts.render`: For rendering templates and generating HTTP responses.

- The views in this module are responsible for generating the content to be displayed in the
  browser based on the received requests.

- Additional views can be added to this module as needed to handle different pages and actions
  within the 'htr' application.

- The views should follow the naming convention of `snake_case` and should be associated with
  specific URL patterns in the 'urls.py' module.

- The views may interact with models, forms, or other components of the 'htr' application
  to process data and generate the appropriate responses.

- Make sure to include this module's views in the 'urls.py' file using appropriate URL patterns
  to map the views to specific URLs.

- The 'Create your views here' comment indicates the location where additional view functions
  can be added.
